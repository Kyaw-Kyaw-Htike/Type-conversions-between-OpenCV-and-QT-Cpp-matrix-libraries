Type conversions between OpenCV and QT C++ matrix libraries

This project provides the automatic matrix class type conversions between OpenCV library and QT cross-platform application framework data types such as QImage and QPixmap. The library also contains a function to display an OpenCV image (in the form of cv::Mat) on QT GUI window.
